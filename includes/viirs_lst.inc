<h2> Background </h2>
<p> Land surface temperature, a key indicator of the Earth surface energy budget, is widely required in applications of hydrology, meteorology, and climatology. It is of fundamental importance to the net radiation budget at the Earth surface and to monitoring the state of crops and vegetation, as well as an important indicator of both the greenhouse effect and the energy flux between the atmosphere and ground (Norman & Becker, 1995; Li & Becker, 1993). The VIIRS LST product, one of the baseline land Environmental Data Records (EDR) for the JPSS mission, is composed of Level 2 (L2) granule LST and Level 3 (L3) gridded LST. The L2 VIIRS LST product was initially generated based on the surface type dependent LST algorithm (Yu et al., 2005) which was then replaced by the emissivity explicit LST algorithm, i.e. enterprise algorithm. The enterprise L2 VIIRS LST reached the provisional and the validated V1 maturity status in February 2019 and November 2019, respectively. The L3 global gridded VIIRS LST was put into operation in May 2020.</p>
