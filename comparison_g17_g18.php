         <p> GOES-18 completed its westward drifting and stayed at 136.8&#186; W on June 7th, 2022. Its view geometry at the new location is very similar to that of the GOES-17 (located at 137.2&#186; W). Products from both platforms are operationally projected to the same GOES-WEST localtion at 137&#186; W, and thus share the same coordinate system. The following shows a direct comparison of their <?= strtolower($pnames[$product]) ?> products for the most recent week including both CONUS and Full Disk coverages.</p>
